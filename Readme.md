Project 5: Recognition using Deep Networks 

This project is about learning how to build, train, analyze, and modify a deep network for a recognition task. We will be using the MNIST digit recognition data set, primarily because it is simple enough to build and train a network without a GPU, but also because it is challenging enough to provide a good example of what deep networks can do.
